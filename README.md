# Defense^2 - A Simple Bloons-Style Game

Defense^2 is a straightforward tower-defense game inspired by Bloons, built using the HaxeFlixel game engine. Though this project is now open-sourced simply because I want to move on to other projects.

It consists of:

- Basic tower defense gameplay mechanics.
- Simple and easy-to-understand game loop.
- Written entirely in HaxeFlixel, making it a great learning resource.
